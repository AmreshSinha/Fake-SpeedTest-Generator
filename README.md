# Fake-SpeedTest-Generator
Like spoofing others by showing your fake SpeedTest result then, use this script for generating one. Site: https://fakespeedtest.000webhostapp.com/

# How It Works
>The user Inputs the Value of Down Speed, UP Speed and Ping and Submits it
>The details gets transferred to Speedtest.net database with the inputed Value
>After processing the user retrieves a real speedtest.net result but with fake values!

# No More PhotoShop
Just Go to your Site where you have uploaded the script and use to make spoof results!

# Note
If you Use it on a remote server then your location in the speedtest image will be of that server only!
>Ques.>How Can You Make a SpeedTest Result with your real location?

>Ans.> Just Simply use XAMPP or WAMP on your personal pc and use script on your personal pc and then you will get your real location and ISP in the speedtest image!

# What Else?
Nothing, Just keep Spoofing others! ;)
