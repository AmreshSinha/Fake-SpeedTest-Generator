# Dependencies

PHP 5.4+

# Site
Working Site: https://fakespeedtest.000webhostapp.com/

# How It Works
The user Inputs the Value of Down Speed, UP Speed and Ping and Submits it

The details gets transferred to Speedtest.net database with the inputed Value

After processing the user retrieves a real speedtest.net result but with fake values!

```In short exploits Ookla Speedtest APIs```

# Note
If you Use it on a remote server then your location in the speedtest result will be of that server only!

Run Locally on WAMP or XAMP server to get your location in the result.
